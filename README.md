### Recommended Web Hosting options
All of the below mentioned options provide an amazing free tier to begin with:
1. Any cheap VPS or cloud providers compute instances like AWS EC2 or Oracle ARM
2. Deployment platforms like [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com) or [fly.io](https://fly.io/)
### Keep the service awake on repl.it
```
Not a preferred way for 24/7 hosting, even with the below mentioned hack - downtime is roughly around 15%.
```
Generally, while using a free tier of services like [repl.it](http://repl.it) and [heroku](https://heroku.com) they tend to sleep the service in case of inactivity, to overcome that we will be using two things:

- First, the [keep_alive.py](./keep_alive.py) module, using multi-threading we initiate another flask app
- Second, a website monitoring or pinger services like [Freshping](https://freshping.io) which will keep our service awake by sending constant GET request to the root route.
